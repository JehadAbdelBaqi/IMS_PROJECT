The application should be able to create, read, update and delete data from and onto the database. The initial functionality of the application is to do this and this alone.

## Application builder

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

To run this application on you local machine you would need to clone the repository from [main](https://github.com/JehadAbdelBaqi/IMS_PROJECT) by clicking on code or forking the repository. You would then need to open the folder using GitBash and running the command _mvn clean package_

repo folder from github link above and moved into target folder. from thre open git bash into the folder and type mvn clean package. open jar.

### Prerequisites

Here are

[GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Git version control command line emulator.  



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
